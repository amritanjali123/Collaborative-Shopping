# Collaborative-Shopping

## THEME
One of the things that differs from online vs offline shopping experience is “shopping together”. This void of
company in online shopping can make it boring over a period of time. Ever wondered how collaborative
shopping can improve shopping experience? Imagine you get to seek your friend’s style tips/suggestions on
the go.
Let us break the traditional myths of e-commerce shopping and bring togetherness. We would call that
Collaborative online shopping. This term refers to an activity in which a consumer shops at an eCommerce
platform with remotely located shopping partners such as friends or family. This brings the best of both the
shopping worlds together.
